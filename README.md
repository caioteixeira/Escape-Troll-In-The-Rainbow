# Escape the Troll on the Rainbow!
Imagine riding a pony away from trolls, burning cats, and dodging rocks. Now, imagine you're the controller with Myo.
The game uses the Myo wrist capturing controller or your Arrow Keys to move you around rocks, while trying to run from a nasty Earthborn Troll. You use the space button or a Hand-Open gesture to shoot fireballs at the demonic kittens.
